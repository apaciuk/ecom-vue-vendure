# Vue Storefront 2 integration with Vendure

This project is a Vendure integration for Vue Storefront 2.

This integration is currently a **Beta** and not ready for production usage. You can help us to make the integration production-ready faster by reporting bugs and contributing to the code at the [repository issues page](https://github.com/vuestorefront/vendure/issues).

## What is Vendure?

Vendure is a modern, headless GraphQL-based e-commerce framework built with TypeScript & Nodejs.

Vendure is a headless framework, meaning that it delivers content through its GraphQL API, leaving you free to implement your store-front applications in the technologies of your choice.

Open Source
Vendure core is available under the MIT license. All development of the core framework is being done in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure).
